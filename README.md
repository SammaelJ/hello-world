Sam's first repository: hello-world

I'm a 31 year old man that has finally figured out what he wants to do when he grows up! For the past ten years I've tolerated my job, trying to find meaning in work that never really interested me. This is the year I make a change. A paradigm shift. A new beginning. My time is now.
